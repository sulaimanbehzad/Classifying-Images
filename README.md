# Visual sentiment analysis based on image caption
In this project we aim to train two classifiers, one on the captions and another one on the images 
## Captions Classifier
- Create a dataframe from given txt files
- Preprocess the text data
- Use Bag of Words (BOW) for tokenization 
- Deep learning model for classificaton
- Analyse the performance of the model - Final accuracy on test data: 90 percent

## Image Classifier
- Data augmentation is used to make up for small dataset
- Feature extraction using Keras's pretrained models
- Created a sequential model for classification
- Compare different models used for feature extraction
- Anlayse the performance of the model- Final accuracy on test data: 70 percent
